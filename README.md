# Pairs Game - Project Two
<!-- explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users. -->

The purpose of this game is to help the user learn the basics of mixology by recognising and naming classic cocktails.

# Features to be implemented
* **Countdown timer** - where game times out if the user takes too long to complete the game.
* **Animations** - flip animations on the cards.
* **Levels** - easy to hard. Harder levels = more pairs to do.
* **Feedback Page** - for the user to send feedback.
* **Info Page** - for user to find more information on each cocktail.

# Technologies used
* **HTML 5** - used to create the basic content of the website.
* **CSS3** - used to add custom styling to the content of the webpage. 
* **JavaScript** - heavily used for the game logic (randomise card, check for correct pairs and reset the pack).
* **Font Awesome** - the project used Font Awesome GitHub and LinkedIn fonts for the social media links.
* **Google Fonts** - used to import a custom font to style the text. 
* **Git** - this was used during production to efficiently commit and push changes to the GitHub repository so no code could be lost. 
* **GitHub** - this was used to create and manage a remote repository which holds all commits and pushed from Git. I made uses of the repository branches to separate and track working changes, in case of bugs, before committing new changes to the master branch.

# Testing
While building the website I regularly used Google Chrome, FireFox, Safari and Edge browsers to render my code, checking for any broken code and incompatibility. One example I found that Firefox and Safari rendered the select tag in HTML with a grey background giving the form fields inconsistent styling. I fixed this by adding a class of form-field-background to each form field with a specified colour. 

I used the Developer Tools built into Chrome to test responsiveness of the website, by selecting different devices. When conducting these tests I found the responsiveness of the home page photo and the form fields needed to be handled with media queries as they had specific break points.  

## HTML & CSS Validator   
To validate my HTML code I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload).

To validate my CSS code I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload).
## Interesting Bugs / Problems
* **Image Loading Time** - when the cards clicked on the images take a time to load, seeming as though the click was not registered. Image files too large.

# Deployment

The page has been deployed to GitHub pages for hosting - [Pairs Game hosted on GitHub pages](https://nkpe.github.io/Pairs-Game/).

I followed the following steps to deploy to GitHub pages: 

1. Opened the repository on GitHub
2. Under 'settings' I found the 'Pages' section in the list on the left. 
3. Under 'source' I chose the master branch and ensured the '/root' folder was selected.

## Running Code Locally
The code can be run locally by downloading from my GitHub repository following these steps: 

1. Click on the green 'Code' button.
2. From the drop down menu select 'download ZIP' or select the relevant clone option.
3. If downloading ZIP, this should be unzipped before running the website locally.
